    <h1>Biltong</h1>

    <h2> Description</h2>
    Biltong is a wonderful snack made by drying meat (generally beef, but game meat can also be used)
    It's great for any occasion. Although it takes some time to make, it also lasts quite a while, so making large batches is recommended.
    <h2> Requirements:</h2>
    Before you start preparing the meat, consider where it will be drying. You need an area with constant airflow. Room temperature is generally fine. The ideal is to have a "biltong box", an enclosed box with a fan blowing in, however this is not necessary. Having a fan constantly blowing on the meat is recommended, or else it may gather mould. 
    
    <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
    Note that this recipe is for 1kg of meat, however as previously stated, I recommend making more than that at a time.

    <ul>
        <li>1kg of beef, ideally silverside or topside</li>
        <li>18g of salt</li>
        <li>1g brown sugar</li>
        <li>4g coriander</li>
        <li>50/50 mix of vinegar and Worcerstershire sauce, enough to marinade the meat in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into 2-2.5CM thick strips</li>
        <li>Dunk the meat in the vinegar mixture, then coat it in the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the meat in a large tray. Place the tray in a fridge and let it marinade for 12 hours</li>
        <li>Mix thoroughly and let the meat marinade for another 12 hours</li>
        <li>Hang the meat in your cool, well ventilated area. Note: don't rince the meat before hanging</li>
        <li>Check the meat in about 4-5 days, depending on how moist you want it. This is up to personal preference</li>
        <li>Store in a cardboard bag, and enjoy at your own pace</li>
    </ol>
